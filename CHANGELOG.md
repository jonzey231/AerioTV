# Changelog

## v1.3.4 — 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- **Live TV guide empty after switching server types.** Deleting an Xtream Codes
  (or M3U) server and re-adding the same source via Dispatcharr API would leave
  the EPG guide blank until a cache wipe. Root cause was three-fold and all
  three have been fixed:
  1. `loadFromCache` now filters `EPGProgram` rows by the active server's ID,
     so orphaned rows from a previous server can no longer leak into the guide.
  2. Deleting a server in Settings now cascade-deletes its `EPGProgram` rows
     instead of leaving them stranded in SwiftData.
  3. On launch, any `EPGProgram` rows whose `serverID` no longer matches an
     existing `ServerConnection` are pruned (one-time cleanup for users
     upgrading from a buggy build).

### Rebrand
- App display name, Info.plist usage strings, and all user-visible copy updated
  to **AerioTV** (previously a mix of "Aerio" / "Dispatcharr").
- About screen now shows accurate device model, last updated date, and first
  install date via a new `DeviceInfo` helper (previously hard-coded/placeholder).

### Notes
- No schema migration required — `EPGProgram.serverID` has existed since the
  model was introduced; existing rows simply had it populated as an empty
  string, which the orphan pruner cleans up automatically.
